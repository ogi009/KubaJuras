## General info
I designed and wrote the application to present myself and my portfolio.
The main page is divided into two screens, on the first screen, a Menu with appropriate links appears (Portfolio, About, Contact), on the second screen, there is a movie that summarizes my career in kitesurfing.
The application is also available in a mobile version.
